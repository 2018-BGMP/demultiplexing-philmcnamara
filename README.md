# Demultiplexing

All initial work from Part 1 is in its own repository

## Unit Tests

*unit_tests* folder holds test files for 10 cases, running the script on these cases gives **unit_test_results.txt**

Output from running demultiplexing.py on unit tests is stored in *demultiplexed* directory

All .fq files created are blank except A1, which holds the "pass" case and the two unknown files

## 2017 Sequencing Data

Running the script on the 2017 sequencing data gives **results.txt**, demultiplexed .fq files are stored on Talapas

Runtime was 28 hours 32 minutes on 8 cores
