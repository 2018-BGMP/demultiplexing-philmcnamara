Create a dictionary:
Keys are the index names
Values are the index sequences

Open read1, index1, read2, and index2 for reading
Read in the first 4 lines from each file and store them as strings, stripping new line characters
Example: read1_header, read1_sequence, read1_plus, read1_quality

Create two string variables, index1 and index2, from the sequence lines of the index files

#Writing to the proper output file based on index
for read 1/read2
	Check if index1/2 is in the dictionary's values
	If it is:
		Open a file for writing named read1/2_(key)
		append the index name and index (key/value) to the end of the read_1/2 header string
		Write all 4 read1/2 strings to the output file
	otherwise:
		Write the read1/2 lines to read1/2_undefined


#Report number of properly matched indexes
if index1 and index2 are equal:
	Increment a properly matched counter

#Report level of index hopping observed 
((total reads - properly matched) / total reads)
